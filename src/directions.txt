Expand on our little project here by adding a button 
that fetches a new image without refreshing the page.
Add a search box so users can search for specific gifs.
 You should also investigate adding a .catch() to manage most errors 
 (i.e. invalid API key). Keep in mind that Giphy responds with a status 
 code of 200 with an empty data array when it doesn’t find any gifs with 
 the searched keyword, in other words the .catch() won’t be executed.
  Adjust your code to effectively handle such scenarios, displaying a 
  default image or an error message if the search fails.
